Here is a description of the projects I worked on for Dr. Ethan Busby of the Political Science Department at Brigham Young University:

Cleaned conjoint experiment results to allow for subsequent MM and AMCE analysis (which I also conducted) on a variety of data sets (POC23, Public22, Academic22)
Ran interactions to understand moderating effect of party affiliation on listening effect in conjoints
Conducted data quality analysis to ensure high-quality conjoint experiment data unaffected by repetition of tasks
Ran gender-specific model analyses
