Welcome to my POLI 428 folder. The class description is as follows:

Political Science 428 (Advanced Statistical Analysis) is considered exceptionally rigorous by both
the faculty and students. It provides a strong foundation in applying regression models using
simulations to understand the properties of those models. In addition to the standard linear
regression model (including logarithmic, polynomial, and interaction models), students learn
generalized linear models (logit, ordered and multinomial logit, count models), and
multilevel/hierarchical model. Students also learn techniques of causal inference including
analyzing experiments, matching, instrumental variable and regression discontinuity models. It
includes training in statistical software (R) and how to estimate both frequentist and Bayesian
models. Students are required to learn how to interpret and present regression results to an
audience without statistical expertise.

I worked on a variety of datasets and conducted a variety of analyses, including some of the following:
Forecasted the Biden vote share (and confidence interval) in 2024 from Leading Economic Indicators data
Analyzed a randomized control trial for HIV infected using Poisson and negative binomial models
Created wage growth models using random coefficients
Replicated Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) analysis on institutional quality, expropriation risk, and economic growth via instrumental variables models
Analyzed close elections and policy outcomes using regression discontinuity designs
