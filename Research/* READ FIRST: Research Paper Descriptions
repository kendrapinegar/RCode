Welcome to my Research Papers folder. I wrote the following research papers with data analysis for classes, as indicated below:

Analysis on how political protests against government performance affects subsequent support for or satisfaction with democracy (solo authored); POLI 340
Analysis on how the widespread prevalence of democracy in the world, in combination with the percentage of internet access in any given country, affects the spread of democracy protests (solo authored); POLI 370
Analysis on how a country's wealth affects the extent of damage that terrorist groups perform, modeled using an terrorist public good-provision as an instrument for low country wealth (co-authored paper with Annie Ackerman Spears, meaning some parts of code were co-written); POLI 476
