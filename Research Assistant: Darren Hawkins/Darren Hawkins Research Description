Welcome to my Darren Hawkins Research folder. I worked on the following projects (some of which are represented here in this folder):

Cleaned and recoded data collected from a Qualtrics survey distributed in Mexico and Peru
Conducted factor analysis of a 17-question index used to measure support for democracy in an attempt to understand which questions fall together
Conducted basic regressions of outcome variables, including and excluding moderator variables, and including and excluding interactions
Conducted power calculations and bayesian factors for a revise and resubmit paper publication for Nature Human Behavior journal
Created plots and charts for publication in journals and presentation in conferences
